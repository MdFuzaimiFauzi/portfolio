![[others/public/logo/dotnet_blazor.png]]From what i did learn, Blazor is a **modern** frontend web framework based on :
1. HTML
2. CSS
3. C#

that helps the developer to build web apps faster.

Since this company uses C# (C Sharp) as the main programming language, using this .Net Blazor can shorten learning and development time.

As long as I know, there is free-source and even a paid version of Blazor. There is a lot of Blazor out there such as :
1. MudBlazor
2. MudRadzen
3. Blazorise
4. Fluent UI Blazor

Throughout of handling the project, we use **MudBlazor**, a free and open-source User Interface (UI) component library for Blazor. 

In my own opinion, using MudBlazor as the component library is very easy. MudBlazor is also offering open-source documentation [[https://mudblazor.com/docs/overview]] for further references.
